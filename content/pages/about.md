Title: about

Rick O. Gilmore is Associate Professor of Psychology and a Huck Institute of the Life Sciences co-funded faculty member. He earned his bachelor's degree *magna cum laude* in Cognitive Science from [Brown University](http://www.brown.edu), and master's and doctoral degrees in Psychology from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu) where he participated in the [Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC)](http://cnbc.cmu.edu) training program in cognitive neuroscience. He was the founding director of Penn State's Social, Life, and Engineering Sciences Imaging Center [(SLEIC)](http://imaging.psu.edu), and oversaw that unit from 2008-2014. Gilmore has won the College of the Liberal Arts tenure-line faculty teaching award and was selected as a faculty marshal.

Gilmore's research focuses on the development of perception, action, and memory, and involves behavioral, brain imaging, and computational modeling. He is interested in the development of brain networks that enable perceivers to extract information about the layout of the environment, the shape of objects, and the speed and direction of self-movement from patterns of visual motion called optic flow. Gilmore is also keenly interested in developing tools and practices that make scientific research more open, transparent, and reproducible. His work has garnered support from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.

Gilmore has served as president of the board of several community organizations -- the [Centre Region Bicycle Coalition](http://centrebike.org), the [Acoustic Brew Concert Series](http://acousticbrew.org), and the [State College Community Theatre](http://scctonline.org). He served on the State College Borough's Transportation Commission and helped lead a successful effort to build the [Bellefonte Central Rail Trail](http://www.traillink.com/trail/bellefonte-central-rail-trail.aspx) through the Penn State Arboretum.
