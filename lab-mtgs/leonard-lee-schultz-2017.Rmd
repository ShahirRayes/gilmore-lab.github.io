>"Button presses were operationalized as a hand pushing down the button. Button presses were coded from videotape by two coders blind to hypotheses and condition (inter-rater reliability $r = .99, p < .001$). Data from a single coder was used for analyses but all results held with the second coder’s data. Coders agreed with the experimenter’s judgment on the termination of the experiment 100% of the time." (Supplement, p. 2)

>"Additionally, a coder blind to condition and hypotheses
coded the tapes for potential confounds. No difference was found across the conditions for whether the parent talked to the child ($\chi^2(2, N=102)=1.03$, p = .60), parents’ proximity to the infant (as distance in inches, H(2) = 4.32, p = .12), and parents’ encouragement to the infant (X2 (2, N = 102) = 5.56, p = .06). Additionally, because the experimenter might have conveyed more enthusiasm in handing the toy to the child in the Effort than the No Effort condition, a
second coder rated the experimenter’s enthusiasm at the start of the test trial on a Likert scale, blind to conditions (W = 525, p = .50)."
