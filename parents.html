	<h1>Penn State Brain Development Lab &bull; Parent Info</h1>    
	<h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>Some parents are surprised to learn how much we can learn from
    studies of infants and children. Dr. Gilmore has been testing infants
    and children for more than 20 years, and he has two daughters of
    his own who have been regular participants in research studies.
    The Penn State Brain Development Lab works very hard to ensure
    that you and your child will be safe and comfortable at all times,
    and that everyone enjoys their visit to the lab. This page is designed
    to help parents prepare for a visit. If you have a question this
    page does not answer, please contact Dr. Gilmore (<a href="mailto:rogilmore@psu.edu">rogilmore@psu.edu</a>; 814-865-3664).
    </p>
    
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <ul id="faqs">
        <li>Where do I go?</li>
        <p>Most of our studies are conducted at Chandlee Laboratory on the main Penn State University Park campus in the Human Electrophysiology Laboratory (HEF).  The HEF has parking set aside for research participants.  We will give you directions to Chandlee Lab, and will make arrangements to meet you before your appointment and guide you to the parking spot.  Here is a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?authuser=0&vps=2&ie=UTF8&hl=en&oe=UTF8&msa=0&msid=217247569859503497087.0004aa9097a284548ff17">map</a> that shows how to enter campus and provides directions to Chandlee.  When you stop at the Parking Kiosk, you should tell the attendant that you are "here for a research study at the imaging center in Chandlee Laboratory."</p>
        <li>How long will it take?</li>
        <p>Most appointments take about 45 min to an hour from start to finish.  If we think we will go longer than that, we will tell you in advance.</p>
        <li>Do I have to come back more than once?</li>
        <p>Some studies involve more than one visit.  Others involve just a single visit.  We will tell you in advance what the study requires.  Sometimes, we may ask you to return if things have either gone especially well, or if we have made a mistake of some kind.  You are under no obligation to participate, but we find that most families are happy to come back if they can make time in their schedule.
        </p>
        <li>What if my child gets tired, fussy, or upset?</li>
        <p>You and your child are in charge.  If your child is unhappy about being in the study, we will stop.</p>
